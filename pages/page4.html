<td><strong>If you're looking to overclock, build a silent PC, or just get your rig operating at peak performance</strong><br><br>
<li>You may want more than stock cooling for your processor.</li><br> 
<li>There are tons of aftermarket CPU coolers out there though, and it can be tough to choose a good one.</li><br>
<li>If you're not interested in complex cooling kits or water cooling.</li><br>
<li>But want to quiet things down or cool things off a good bit without spending a lot of money</li><br>
<li>The Hyper 212 EVO from Cooler Master is a great kit for you.</li><br><br>
Even if you're buying a stock processor and want a little something more, this kit is small, effective, affordable, and will keep your processor cool and happy no matter what you do with it. It's not as advanced as some of the other kits in the roundup, but that's okayâ€”it's also not as expensive.</td>

<td><strong>Swiftech's H220-X liquid cooling system is a self-contained</strong><br><br>
<li>All-in-one CPU cooling system that includes a 120mm copper radiator</li><br>
<li>A water pump, and a waterblock, all in one easy to install and easy to fill and set-up package.</li><br>
<li>The entire setup is designed to be whisper-quiet, near inaudible for most people</li><br> 
<li>And keep your processor nice and cool whether you just want a nice silent PC</li><br> 
<li>Or you plan to overclock and run that processor like crazy.</li><br>
<li>Swiftech designed the system to be easy to install as well</li><br>
<li>The waterblock and fans at the top of your case and closed loop right over the processor to minimize space and keep clear of other components.</li><br><br>
 If you like lights in your case, the reservoir is LED backlit, which looks pretty cool but also allows you to check the coolant level to make sure nothing's wrong.

<td><strong>Corsair's Hydro series is pretty well regarded around here, and for good reason.<br></strong><br> 
<li>They're easy to install, easy to configure, get the job done, and are relatively maintenance-free.</li><br>
<li>The H-110 is one of the more popular options in the Hydro series</li><br>
<li>affordable option for people looking to do water cooling without spending a ton of money in the process.</li><br><br>
The H-110 is an all-in-one liquid cooling unit that packs a pair of 140mm fans that fits nicely in a 280mm radiator mount, along with a closed loop that's small enough to stay in direct contact with your processor but still easy to mount and install without risk of leaking (thanks to the easy-bend tubing leading to and away from the copper cold plate.</td>
